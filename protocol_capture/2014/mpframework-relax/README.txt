### Description
Structural refinement cna reveal an enesemble of states describing the conformation of a protein. This is important for membrane proteins as many structures are elucidated at low resolution. The membrane relax application combines the membrane framework with the FastRelax algorithm to refine membrane proteins tructures. Cycles of sidechain optimization and minimization with the membrane high resolution energy function are used to sample possible conformations. In addition, several iterations of minimization over the membrane residue are performed simultaneoulsy with whole structure minimization to optimize the position of the membrane. 

### Executable/Script
This application uses the membrane framework and is implemented as a Rosetta script. THe script included in this file is called membrane_relax.xml which can be run via the 
rosetta_scripts executable. 

### Generating Inputs
The membrane relax application requires 2 input files: 

  1. Generating a Spanfile
  A spanfile describing transmembrane spanning regions can be generated using the OCTOPUS server (http://octopus.cbr.su.se/). This file must be converted to a Rosetta spanfile format using octopus2span.pl. Example command is given below: 

    cd mpframework-ddG/scripts/
    ./octopus2span.pl octopus_pred.out > spanfile.txt

  2. Generating a Lipsfile
  A lips file can be generated by running the predict_lips.pl script. This requires an installation of blast (not blast++). Example command given below: 

    cd mpframework-ddG/scripts/
    ./predict_lips.pl <fasta file> <spanfile> /path/to/blastpgp /path/to/nrdb alignblast.pl

### Useful Scripts
This demo contains a script directory with: 
  - octopus2span.pl: Convert OCTOPUS topology prediction to Rosetta spanfile format
  - predict_lips.pl: Use the TMPLIP server to predict per-residue lipophilicity
  - alignblast.pl: Perform and parse multiple sequnece alignment from psiblast (needed 
    for predict_lips.pl)
    
### Running the Application

1. Required Flags 
To run this applicaiton, the minimum required flags are described below. Flags are also included
in a flags file in this demo: 

flags                                  descriptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-parser:protocol membrane_relax.xml    Specify membrane relax protocol to rosetta scripts executable
-in:file:s <pdbfile>                   Input PDB Structure: Asymmetric input structure (should have been 
                                       generated as mystruct_input.pdb after running make_symmdef_file.pl)
-in:ignore_unrecognized_res            Ignore unrecognized residues during initial PDB parsing (standard
                                       Rosetta flag)
-membrane_new:setup:spanfiles          Spanfile describing spanning topology of starting structure 
                                       for full symmetric structure
-membrane_new:scoring:hbond            Turn on depth-dependent hydrogen bonding term when using the   
                                       membrane high resolution energy function
-relax:fast                            Use the FastRelax mode of Rosetta Relax (uses 5 repeat cycles)
-relax:jump_move true                  Minimize over the membrane jumps
-packing:pack_missing_sidechains false Skip initial packing (will be reapplied during membrane framework 
                                       initialization)
-nstruct                               Number of structures to generate
