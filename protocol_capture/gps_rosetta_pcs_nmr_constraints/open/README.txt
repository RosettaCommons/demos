Protocol Overview:
=================

The protocol is divided in 2 distinct stages, '1_weights' and '2_gps'. The 'setup' folder contains necessary input data required to carry the protocol. The relevant publications associated with this protocol are given in references

1_weights:
----------
PCS data from the individual metal centers should be weighted relative to Rosetta's centroid scoring function. In this example system PCS data from 4 lanthanide binding tags are used. Each tag contains PCS data from two different lanthanides namely, Thulium and Terbium, making a total of 8 paramagnetic samples.
PCS weights are calculated for each of the 4 metal tags. pcsTs[1-4] which are patched to the Rosetta's centroid scoring function.

2_gps:
------
The is the production run which uses PCS data as restraints to direct the conformational sampling towards the direction which fits the input PCS data.
Since PCSs are usually measured for backbone atoms, PCS data is used in Rosetta's low-resolution fragment assembly step only. Rosetta's high resolution 'Relax' protcol doesn't score PCS data.
This protocol in particular uses PCS data from 4 lanthanide binding tags, analogous to GPS satellites and therefore termed as GPS-Rosetta simulation.
