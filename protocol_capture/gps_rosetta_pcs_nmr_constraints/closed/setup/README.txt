Setup Description:
===========

Required input files to carry out the protocol are present in this 'setup' folder.
All the files should be changed for your target accordingly.

Rosetta Fragment files:
----------------------
Typically generated with Robetta fragment server (http://www.robetta.org/fragmentsubmit.jsp) using sequence and backbone chemical shift information of the target protein as input.
The frag9 and frag3 files are present in this folder as (frag9_dvp.tab) and (frag3_dvp.tab). These files should  be replaced for your target accordingly.

Pseudocontact Shift (PCS) input files:
--------------------------------------
Experimental PCSs are derived from a previously published study by (de la Cruz et al).
PCSs should be given as input in Numbat (.npc) format. which is present in 4 columns: Each file should contain PCS from a single metal type only.

1. residue number
2. Spin type
3. PCS value
4. tolerance

Starting Model Structure:
-------------------------

The input starting model structure should should be given as input as PDB file. The PDB file should contain a both constant and flexible regions.
The constant and flexible regions should be defined in the input broker files.

Broker files:
------------
The broker claimers are given in 2 separate files, rigid_broker.txt and rigid_plus_pcs_broker.txt

1.rigid_broker.txt
------------------
# constrain the coordinates to the input starting model using 'CoordConstraintClaimer'
# define the constant region in the target, given in 'RIGID' line section in 'RigidChunkClaimer'

CLAIMER CoordConstraintClaimer
PDB_FILE ../setup/ideal_model.pdb
# input starting model PDB file name as input
ASK_FOR_ROOT ALL
POTENTIAL BOUNDED 0.0 4 1 xyz
END_CLAIMER

CLAIMER RigidChunkClaimer
pdb ../setup/ideal_model.pdb
# input starting model PDB file name as input
REGION
# Define the constant rigid region here
RIGID 1 15 0 0
RIGID 54 247 0 0
END_REGION
END_CLAIMER

2. rigid_plus_pcs_broker.txt
----------------------------
This file contains the same broker claimers as rigid_broker.txt plus PseudocontactShiftEnergyController_Ts[1-4], where [1-4] defines for each of the 4 tag PCS data.
A total of 6 claimers, 2 coordinate claimers and 4 claimers for each of the metal tag.
The 'PseudocontactShiftEnergyController' Claimer defines the parameters for input PCS data and spherical grid to search for metal center and to fit the PCS data. The details for individual parameters are given as comments within the broker file. The method for grid search for a single tag is described in (Schmitz et al) and the extension for multiple tags is given in (Yagi et al).
