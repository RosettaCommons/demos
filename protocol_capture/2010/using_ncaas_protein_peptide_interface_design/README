# Protocol Name:
P. Douglas Renfrew, Eun Jung Choi, Brian Kuhlman. Using Noncanonical Amino Acids in Computational Protein-Peptide Interface Design

# Brief Description:
This is four separate protocol captures that describe the four different ways Rosetta was used in the accompanying publication: creating Rosetta ResidueType parameter files for NCAAs, creating backbone dependent rotamer libraries for NCAAs, calculating explicit unfolded state reference energies for NCAAs, and the running of the DougsDockDesignMinimizeInterface protocol using NCAAs. The protocol caputres for creating ResidueType paramater files, rotamer libraries and explicite unfolded state energies describe the process used in the publication but are written from the standpoint of a researcher looking to add an additional NCAA to Rosetta. 

### running #########
See README files for individual files for descriptions about each part was run. 

### versions #########
The code for this protocol capture is completely checked into trunk rXXXXX and database rYYYYY.
