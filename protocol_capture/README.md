Protocol Captures
=================
KEYWORDS: GENERAL GENERAL
This directory serves as an archive of protocol captures for a selection of Rosetta papers.

The version of the protocol capture that are in this directory correspond to the version which was published. 
As Rosetta has likely changed since their original publication, these protocol captures may not work witth
the current version of Rosetta. (Each protocol capture should indicate the version or Rosetta against which
they were originally tested, or at least a general time period.)

Most of the protocol captures here have a corresponding demo in the demos/public/ directory.
The version in demos/public should be kept up-to-date with the most recent version of Rosetta.

Note: the layout of this directory has changed several times. The protocol captures may have been moved.

Note to Rosetta developers: If you add a protocol capture here, you should also add a copy as the 
updatable version in the demos/public/ directory.
