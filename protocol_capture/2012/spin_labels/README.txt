The input, config, and bin directories have some common materials for the
substeps of the protocol. Each subdirectory has its own input, config, and
bin directories with specific materials for that step. Each subdirectory also
has its own README.txt with specific information about that step. Each step is
entirely self contained, but you might enjoy working through them in the order
given below.
