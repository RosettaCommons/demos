MP Viewer Protocol Capture
==========================
KEYWORDS: MEMBRANES, ANALYSIS

Visualization with the mp_viwer application: Adjust the path to the executable and the Rosetta
database in the cmd_mpviewer.sh file. Open PyMOL and then run the cmd file in a regular terminal outside of PyMOL:
        
   > ./cmd_mpviewer.sh
        
This app does not require the presence of a membrane residue, but it does require a span file.
Both input PDB and span file are given in the input folder.
