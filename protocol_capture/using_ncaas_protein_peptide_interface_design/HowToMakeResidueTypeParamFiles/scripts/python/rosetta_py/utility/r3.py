'''Functions for dealing with vectors and points in 3-space (R3).

Adapted from IWD's driftwood.r3.Triple class in Java.
The object is to be correct, not necessarily fast.

Functions work on anything with .x, .y, and .z properties defined.
Later I may include support for numeric indexing instead [0], [1], [2]
and/or support for NumPy array objects.
