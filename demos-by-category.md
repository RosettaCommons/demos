Tutorials
=========

Tutorials intended as a gentle introduction to Rosetta concepts, and using common functionality of Rosetta.

Demos
=====

These demos are designed to guide users through sample procedures in computational modeling from the point of view of solving a specific problem. 

Full input files for the demos are located in the `demos/public/` directory of the Rosetta distribution.

Protocol Captures
=================

Many papers using Rosetta are accompanied by a protocol capture - an example of how to use the protocol discussed in the paper. The protocol captures below aren't meant to show the best way to solve problems in the current version of Rosetta, instead they are meant to show published solutions to problems that were addressed by members of the Rosetta community. The purpose of these protocol captures is both to serve as a historical record and to assist those trying to reproduce past results. See the demos (above) for updated versions of most protocol captures.

Full input files for the protocol captures are located in the demos/protocol_capture/ directory of the Rosetta distribution.

Under Development
=================

If you want to prevent a demo from being published to the static wiki until you've finished developing it or written a paper on it or something, put it in `demos/pilot`.
It will be visible here, but not on the public site.
