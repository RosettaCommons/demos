##
## 1. identifies positions where an arginine rotamer could possible contact one of the dna positions
##    given with the -pdb_pos argument. These are redesigned. Then looks for positions within 10A (based
##    on some single sidechain atom). These are repacked. Everything else is fixed.
## 2.  Then it redesigns.
##
## 3. currently generates a debugging pdb with the bfactor column indicating whether a position was
##    fixed/packed/or designed (25,50,75) -- called "pack_or_design.pdb"
