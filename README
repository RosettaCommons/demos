### demo testing system ###
### To be run form /Rosetta/demos ###
### to verify that demos work, run the following for all tests ###
python demos.py -s ~/Rosetta/main/source/ -d ~/Rosetta/main/database/
This will execute the "command" file in each public/sub_dir
Output is placed in a directory Rosetta/demos/public.run/sub_dir

### or just for one test
python demos.py -s ~/Rosetta/main/source/ -d ~/Rosetta/main/database/ demo_name
### for example:
python demos.py -s ~/Rosetta/main/source/ -d ~/Rosetta/main/database/ prepare_pdb_for_rosetta_with_relax

Demos that do not yet have a command file are likely to work, but are not yet covered by the testing system. 

To set up a new demo look at the example in prepare_pdb_for_rosetta_with_relax. You just need to add a file named "command" using the one in 0_HOW_TO_MAKE_DEMOS as a template. The command file should list, in order, the scripts and command lines to run the protocol, or at least a short version of the protocol.
