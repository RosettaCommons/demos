#How To Read These Tutorials
These tutorials were written such that a completely new user should be able to complete them in numeric order through Tutorial 10 and thereby gain an understanding of the basic mechanics of Rosetta. Prior to doing any of the later tutorials, run through Tutorials 1-10.
##Before Running Any of the Other Tutorials
Complete Tutorial 1 to install and compile rosetta; verify that the Rosetta/main/bin directory contains executables appropriate to your installation.
##Do The Following for Each Tutorial
In order for the hands-on portions of these tutorials to function correctly, you must make your current working directory that of the tutorial you want to run; IE for this tutorial, your current working directory must be (IE "you must be in") Rosetta/demos/tutorials/tutorial_0.
Therefore, cd into the directory for the tutorial you want to run; see Tutorial 2 for a brief description of how to use cd.
