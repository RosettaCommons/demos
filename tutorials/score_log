 Rosetta Tool:   score   -  rescores PDBs and silent files, extracts PDBs from silent files, assembles PDBs into silent files. 
 Usage:                                                                  
   PDB input:      -in:file:s *.pdb   or  
                   -in:file:l  list_of_pdbs  
                   -no_optH                                    Dont change positions of Hydrogen atoms! (default true, specify false if you want optH)
   Silent input:   -in:file:silent silent.out                  silent input filesname 
                   -in:file:tags                               specify specific tags to be extracted, if left out all will be taken 
                   -in:file:fullatom                           for full atom structures 
                   -in:file:binary_silentfile                  for non-ideal structures (such as from looprelax) 
                   -in:file:silent_optH                        Call optH when reading silent files (useful for HisD/HisE determination)
                   -score_app:linmin                           Run a quick linmin before scoring
   Native:         -in:file:native                             native PDB (rms, maxsub and gdtm scores will be calculated)
   Scorefunction:  -score:weights  weights                     weight set or weights file 
                   -score:patch  patch                         patch set 
                   -score:optH_weights                         Weights file for optH (default standard.wts w/ sc12 patch)
                   -score:optH_patch                           Weights patch file for optH
                   -rescore:verbose                            display score breakdown 
   Output:         -out:nooutput                               don't print PDB structures (default now) 
                   -out:output                                 force printing of PDB structures 
                   -out:file:silent                            write silent-out file 
                   -out:file:scorefile name                    write scorefile (default default.sc)
                   -out:prefix  myprefix                       prefix the output structures with a string 
  Examples: 
   score  -database ~/minirosetta_database -in:file:silent silent.out -in::file::binary_silentfile -in::file::fullatom -native 1a19.pdb 
   Will rescore all structures in silent.out, in full atom mode and accounting for nonideal structure if present. Additionally 
   it will print a PDB for every structure with -out:output flag
