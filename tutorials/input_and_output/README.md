Summary
-------
There are multiple ways to control how Rosetta protocols read the nput and produce output. By the end of this tutorial, you should understand:

* What input formats are supported in Rosetta
* How to deal with odd residues that often cause Rosetta to crash
* How best to prepare an input structure
* How to ask Rosetta to compare it with a known structure
* How to change the input and output paths in Rosetta
* How to ensure that you get a consistent running trajectory despite being a Monte Carlo protocol
* How to visualize the changes to the structure in PyMOL
* How to overwrite existing output

>This chapter will cover many executables, whose function will not be explained in much detail. Please refer the the corresponding chapter in the tutorials for a proper explanation of what that particular program does.

Navigating to the Demos
-----------------------
The demos are available at `<path_to_Rosetta_directory>/demos/tutorials/input_and_output`. All demo commands listed in this tutorial should be executed when in this directory. All the demos here use the `linuxgccrelease` binary. You may be required to change it to whatever is appropriate given your operating system and compiler.

Controlling Input
-----------------
###Common Stucture Input Files
You can supply Rosetta with a variety of input files which hold the coordinates of your biomolecular structure.
####PDB File
The most common input file format is the PDB format. A detailed description of the PDB format can be found on the [WorldWide Protein Data Bank website](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html). Primarily the lines which concern Rosetta start with `ATOM`, `HETATM` and `TER`.

```html
...
ATOM   1477 3HD2 LEU A  94      10.910  -5.038   7.227  1.00  0.00           H  
TER                                                                             
HETATM 1479  O   HOH A 107      10.027  -4.206  14.093  1.00  0.00           O 
...
```
In the example above, Rosetta recognizes that the `ATOM` record represents one of the H<sub>δ</sub> atoms of Leucine-94 in the A chain with coordinates (10.910, -5.038, 7.227), which has an occupancy of 1 and a temperature factor of 0. Rosetta ignores the atom numbering (`1477`) in the second column and the element symbol in the last column (`H`). The `TER` record indicates a chain break. Similarly the `HETATM` record represents the oxygen atom of a water molecule associated with the A chain with coordinates (10.027, -4.206, 14.093) an occupancy 1 and a temperature factor of 0. Rosetta ignores the atom numbering and the element symbol in this record too. Rosetta stores the temperature factors, but **assumes all non-zero occupancies to be 1.**

To pass in a single PDB use the `in:file:s` option. For example, the following can be used to [calculate the energy](https://www.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/scoring/README) of a refined PDB 1QYS. The input PDB is present in the `input_files` folder.

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:s input_files/1qys.pdb
    
Running this should produce a file called `score.sc` in your current working directory with the energy scores of 1QYS. *To proceed on to the next step, remove `score.sc` by typing `rm score.sc`. Else, all energy scores of the structures scored here onwards will be appended to this file.*

####List of PDBs
Suppose you want to pass multiple input structures to an executable, use the option `in:file:l`. Say, you want to score two PDBs - 1QYS and 1UBQ. We can pass a list of PDBs called `pdblist`, which contains one path to PDB per line (space separated PDBs work, but they cannot be comma or semi-colon separated) like this:

    input_files/1qys.pdb
    input_files/1ubq.pdb
    
To run, execute:

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:l input_files/pdblist
    
    
Running this should produce a file called `score.sc` in your current working directory. *To proceed on to the next step, remove `score.sc` by typing `rm score.sc`. Else, all energy scores of the structures scored here onwards will be appended to this file.*

####Silent File
A silent file is a Rosetta-specific compact format file which stores information from multiple structures. It is especially useful when running simulations with a large number of output structures, where many filesystems will have problems running batch operations. Silent files can be generated by many Rosetta simulations. An example of a _binary silent struct file_ can be found at `<path_to_Rosetta_directory>/demos/tutorials/input_and_output/input_files/1qys.o `.

The first few lines represent the information about the sequence, energy and relative rotation/translation of the chains. The main body, however, is not human readable.

There is another silent file format called _protein silent struct file_ that is human readable, but Rosetta sometimes is unable to output in this format and hence, it is not discussed in this tutorial. Details about this can be found [here](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/rosetta_basics/file_types/silent-file).

To give Rosetta a silent file as an input, use the `in:file:silent` option while running your command like this:

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:silent input_files/1qys.o
    
You should again produce a file called `score.sc` in your current working directory with the energy scores of 1QYS. _To proceed on to the next step, remove `score.sc` by typing `rm score.sc`. Else, all energy scores of the structures scored here onwards will be appended to this file._

_The option `in:file:silent` can also be used to pass a list of silent files._

####mmCIF File
Rosetta also supports a more recent file format called mmCIF whose details can be found [here](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/tutorials/content/atomic-description.html). You can use the `in:file:s` option to input mmCIF files as well, and Rosetta automatically wether the file is format is mmCIF or PDB.

Try running:

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:s input_files/1qys.cif -ignore_unrecognized_res -ignore_zero_occupancy false
    
>**TO BE FINISHED WHEN MMCIF JOB INPUTTER IS MERGED INTO MASTER**


###Dealing with Odd Residues/Waters
Most Rosetta protocols expect the structure they are working on to have a certain set of properties, eg. all heavy atoms should be present, all residue names should be recognizable etc. Sometimes Rosetta can guess which atoms to add. In this example, we will score the PDB 1QYS taken directly from the Protein Data Bank:

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:s input_files/from_rcsb/1qys.pdb
    
In the log, you will see the following lines:
```html
...
core.io.pose_from_sfr.PoseFromSFRBuilder: Reading MSE as MET!
...
core.pack.pack_missing_sidechains: packing residue number 13 because of missing atom number 6 atom name  CG
...
```
The first line indicates that it converts the residue _MSE_, i.e. selenomethionine to _MET_, i.e. regular methionine. The second line tells you that Rosetta found that the C<sub>γ</sub> atom was missing in residue number 13, and built the sidechain for residue number 13.

####Unrecognized Residues
A PDB downloaded directly from the Protein Data Bank may or may not work with Rosetta in general. Here's an example where we try to score the PDB 3TDM. When in the right demo directory, run:

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:s input_files/from_rcsb/3tdm.pdb
   
The application will exit with the following error:

    ERROR: Unrecognized residue: PO4
    
This PDB contains a phosphate ion that Rosetta is unable to process without additional options. To score this PDB, we will add an option `-ignore_unrecognized_res`, which simply ignores the phosphates in the PDB.

    $> <path_to_Rosetta_directory>/main/source/bin/score_jd2.linuxgccrelease -in:file:s input_files/from_rcsb/3tdm.pdb -ignore_unrecognized_res

Now the PDB will be scored and the score will be displayed in a file `score.sc`.

>`ignore_unrecognized_res` option also ignores the water molecules in the structure. This may change the energy scores of your structure.

####Waters

>**Skipping this section till the default status of HOH is clarified. Presently, they are loaded in and scored, but -ignore_unrcognized_res takes them out and changes score.**

####Zero Occupancy
