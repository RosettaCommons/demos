# MiniRosetta resfile
# Comments start with a # and go to the end of a line.  Comments may be placed anywhere.
# Blank lines are ignored.  
#
# A residue record starts with the pose residue number and is followed by commands.  
# Resfiles recognize the following commands (in arbitrary order, whitespace-delimited):
# ALLAA -- All canonical amino acids except CYS.
#          Deprecated.  Matches existing meaning of ALLAA in rosetta++.
#          In the future, its behavior will be to include CYS.
#
# ALLAAxc -- All canonical amino acids except CYS
#
# ALLAAwc -- All canonical amino acids including CYS
#
# PIKAA <AASTRING> -- Include only the canonical amino acids given in the AASTRING
#
# NOTAA <AASTRING> -- Exclude the canonical amino acids given in the AASTRING
#
# POLAR  -- Include canonical amino acids that are polar
#
# APOLAR -- Include canonical amino acids that are non-polar
#
# APOLA  -- Include canonical amino acids that are non-polar.  Deprecated.
#
# NATRO  -- Do not pack or design this position (native rotamer).  
#
# NATAA  -- Do not design this position but do allow repacking.  
#
# EX (ARO) <CHIID> (LEVEL <SAMPLELEVEL>) -- Increase the rotamer sampling level.
#                                           ARO is optional.  LEVEL is optional.
#
# Resfiles begin with a set of default behaviors.  Any residue that does not have a 
# specific behavior specified has the default behavior specified.
#
# The 'start' token tells the resfile reader that default behavior has finished and that
# residue-specific behavior has begun.  Residue specific behaviors must all be on one line.
# The first token on that line must be the residue number.
#
# If a resfile specifies a default behavior but does not specify any residue-specific behavior,
# then the 'start' token may be left off, though it is not advised.  If it is left off, 
# a warning will be sent to the screen.  If it is put in (even in the absence of any 
# residue specific behavior) the warning will not be sent to the screen and the default
# behavior will be applied to all residues.
