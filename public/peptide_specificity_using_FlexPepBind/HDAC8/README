To run the HDAC8 FlexPepBind protocol: 
1.run fpbind_run.sh script (located in the scripts directory).This will minimize the peptide-protein complexes after threading peptide sequences one by one onto the template.
2.run fpbind_analysis.sh (located in the scripts directory). This will extract the relevant scores (I_sc, reweighted_sc, pep_sc, pep_sc_noref) of the minimized structures & save them in the score_analysis/ directory.

Example

$ scripts/fpbind_run.sh 
$ scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh

The output contains scores for each peptide, according to different scoring terms. For HDAC8 FlexPepBind, we found that the interface score (I_sc) provides the best ranking.

$ paste input_files/peptide.list score_analysis/I_sc 
GYKFGC	-16.757
GFKWGC	-17.108
GFKFGC	-16.352
GMKDGC	-13.870
GDKDGC	-13.179
GQKIGC	-13.408

The Interface scores are given for 6 peptides (the top 3 are HDAC8 substrates & the bottom 3 are not HDAC8 substrates.
