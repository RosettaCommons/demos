To run the protocol on each system go the directory and then
1.run fpbind_run.sh script located in the scripts directory.This will minimize the peptide-protein complexes after threading peptide sequence one by one onto the template.
2.run fpbind_analysis.sh located in the scripts directory. It will extract the relevent scores (I_sc, reweighted_sc, pep_sc, pep_sc_noref) of the minimized structures & save it in score_analysis/ directory.

Ex.

$ cd HDAC8/
$ scripts/fpbind_run.sh 
$ scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh

The output is the score with different scoring term 
For example in score_analysis/I_sc

$ paste input_files/peptide.list score_analysis/I_sc 
GYKFGC	-16.757
GFKWGC	-17.108
GFKFGC	-16.352
GMKDGC	-13.870
GDKDGC	-13.179
GQKIGC	-13.408

Interface scores for 6 peptide (top 3 are HDAC8 substrates & bottom 3 are not HDAC8 substrates)
