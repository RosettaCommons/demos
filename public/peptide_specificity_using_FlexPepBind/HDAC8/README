Here we describe the various input files needed to run the FlexPepBind protocol on HDAC8.

2v5w.pdb      : The HDAC8-peptide complex structure
template.pdb  : The template structure created from 2v5w
substrates    : list of HDAC8 peptide substrates
nonsubstrates : list of HDAC8 peptide non-substrates
peptide.list  : list of peptide sequence to the the FlexPepBind protocol on. It contains both the substrates and the non-substrates
activity      : percent deacetylation of the peptides listed in peptide.list file
resfile       : threading instruction (see more on resfile at https://www.rosettacommons.org/manuals/archive/rosetta3.5_user_guide/d1/d97/resfiles.html)
minimization_flags : file containing list of flags for running FlexPepDock minimization
constraints.cst : list of constraints used during the minimization

Starting with the complex structure 2v5w a template pdb was created following the steps mentioned below:
a. The input pdb was cleaned by removing solvent molecules.
b. Only a monomer bound to a peptide was copied from the solved dimeric structure
c. The receptor structure was prepacked to remove internal clashes. (see the demo refinement_of_protein_peptide_complex_using_FlexPepDock/ to know how to run prepacking).
d. The peptide substrates GYKacFGC was threaded to the template peptide backbone and optimize extensively using the refinement protocol (see the demo refinement_of_protein_peptide_complex_using_FlexPepDock/ to know how to run refinement) and the best optmized structure was used as the template.


Run the HDAC8 FlexPepBind protocol as: 

$ scripts/fpbind_run.sh 
$ scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh

The output contains scores for each peptide, according to different scoring terms. For HDAC8 FlexPepBind, we found that the interface score (I_sc) provides the best ranking.

$ paste input_files/peptide.list score_analysis/I_sc 
GYKFGC	-16.757
GFKWGC	-17.108
GFKFGC	-16.352
GMKDGC	-13.870
GDKDGC	-13.179
GQKIGC	-13.408

The Interface scores are given for 6 peptides (the top 3 are HDAC8 substrates & the bottom 3 are not HDAC8 substrates; the score might vary depending on the rosetta version and socirng function being used).
