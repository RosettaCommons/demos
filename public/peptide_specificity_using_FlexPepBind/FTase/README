To run the FTase FlexPepBind protocol:

1.run the fpbind_run.sh script (located in the scripts directory). This will minimize the peptide-protein complexes after threading peptide sequences one by one onto the template.
2.run fpbind_analysis.sh (located in the scripts directory). This will extract the relevant scores (I_sc, reweighted_sc, pep_sc, pep_sc_noref) of the minimized structures & save them in the score_analysis/ directory.

Example:

$ scripts/fpbind_run.sh 
$ scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh

The scoring term that worked best for FTase FlexPepBind is pep_sc_noref. The output is in score_analysis/pep_sc_noref

$ paste input_files/peptide.list score_analysis/pep_sc_noref
CSII	-4.9
CLIT	-3.2
CFLS	-2.2
CKKP	 7.6
CTKR	10.7
CSIP	 5.4

The pep_sc_noref scores are lister for 6 peptides (the top 3 are FTase substrates & the bottom 3 are not FTase substrates)
