To run the protocol on each system go the directory and then
1.run fpbind_run.sh script located in the scripts directory.This will minimize the peptide-protein complexes after threading peptide sequence one by one onto the template.
2.run fpbind_analysis.sh located in the scripts directory. It will extract the relevent scores (I_sc, reweighted_sc, pep_sc, pep_sc_noref) of the minimized structures & save it in score_analysis/ directory.

Ex.

$ cd FTase/
$ scripts/fpbind_run.sh 
$ scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh

The output is the score with different scoring term 
For example in score_analysis/pep_sc_noref

$ paste input_files/peptide.list score_analysis/pep_sc_noref
CSII	-4.9
CLIT	-3.2
CFLS	-2.2
CKKP	 7.6
CTKR	10.7
CSIP	 5.4

Pep_sc_noref scores for 6 peptide (top 3 are FTase substrates & bottom 3 are not FTase substrates)
