This demo shows how to model the 3D structure of an RNA-protein complex starting from a protein structure and RNA sequence.


## Setting up the demo: 

1. Install Rosetta RNA tools. See instructions and documentation [here](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/rna/RNA-tools).

## Brief explanation of input files:
