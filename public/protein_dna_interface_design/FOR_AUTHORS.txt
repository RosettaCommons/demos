The task here is to redesign a protein at a protein/DNA interface. 

The given structure is 2h7h.pdb the Crystal structure of the JUN BZIP homodimer complexed with AP-1 DNA.

Your task is to use rosetta to redesign the protein in this crystal structure to stabilize its interaction with DNA.
You should be able to use RosettaScripts for this but any method will do.


If you can, include ways of analyzing your output to figure out which design is best.

The contents of each demo directory should be:

starting_files/
  -- directory in which the raw input files are given - these
     are provided for you and serve as the base for your
     tutorial
rosetta_inputs/
  -- directory in which the modified starting files should
     be placed which will be used as inputs to Rosetta.
     You may need to make modifications like stripping
     extra chains from the input PDB; store the modified
     PDB here and leave the unaltered one in starting_files 
scripts/
  -- python scripts, shell scripts, used in the workflow
  -- awk, grep, sed, etc. command lines

README.dox
  -- A prose or list description of how to perform the protocol

FOR_AUTHORS.txt
  -- A description for the demo creators of what their demo
     should achieve.
  -- Most of what starts in this file should end up in the
     README file as well.
