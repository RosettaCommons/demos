A common stumbling block for researchers who are considering using
Rosetta is the structures they are interested in working with are
quite large, bigger than 1000 residues. While many protocols will not
be appropriate for structures this large, some are still things that
can be done. This demo should demonstrate how to use minimization with
large strctures:

   * Minimize a specific set of residues while keeping the rest fixed
     - Use the FastRelax mover in Rosetta scripts to minize a portion of 3E0C.pdb (in the starting_files directory). You can use the MoveMap xml subtag syntax.
     - https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/Movers/movers_pages/FastRelaxMover

   * It will be important to identify flags etc. that are important for handling large structures.  For example, use of the linmem integration graph to keep memory usage down.

   * Another goal of this tutorial will be the creation of output in silent file format and the extraction of those decoys into pdb file format
