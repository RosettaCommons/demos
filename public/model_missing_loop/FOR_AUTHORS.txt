The purpose of this demo is to show how Rosetta
can be used to model portions of a crystal structure
where the density of several consecutive residues
is missing.

In this demo, residues 32-36 of vinculin (1tr2) 
have missing density.  Only the first 132 residues
of the N-terminal portion of vinculin should be used.
(This is a 1000 residue protein). These five residues
also have coordinates reported, but, pretend that they
do not.  That is, create a new PDB input file for
Rosetta where residues 32-36 have been removed.

The sequence for these five residues is VDGKA.

Note that several MSE residues are present in this
structure and should be treated as MET by Rosetta.
