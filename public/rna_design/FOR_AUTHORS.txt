The goal of this demo is to redesign an RNA sequence using the
structure of the Internal Loop of SRP (PDB 1lnt) as a backbone
template. The raw pdb file is included in the starting_files/
directory. You should feel free to reduce the size of the structure if
you want, but make sure to mention how/why you did this. This demo
should outline how to setup your initial structures and how
to run design. Give any scripts and command lines used for this
procedure and some analysis of your results. If you use silent
files make sure you mention how to extract them.

A good starting point for this would be the manual:
http://www.rosettacommons.org/manuals/archive/rosetta3.1_user_guide/app_RNA_design.html 
There is also a scientific test which could prove useful:
mini/test/scientific/tests/rna_design/
There are also a few prep scripts in demo which could help make everything rosetta friendly.
mini/demo/rna/


GENERAL STUFF:
The entire workflow for this demo should be described in a file
named README.dox.  It should describe an entire work flow, with
command lines, tested if possible.

The contents of each demo directory should be:

starting_files/
  -- directory in which the raw input files are given - these
     are provided for you and serve as the base for your
     tutorial
rosetta_inputs/
  -- directory in which the modified starting files should
     be placed which will be used as inputs to Rosetta.
     You may need to make modifications like stripping
     extra chains from the input PDB; store the modified
     PDB here and leave the unaltered one in starting_files 
scripts/
  -- python scripts, shell scripts, used in the workflow
  -- awk, grep, sed, etc. command lines

README.dox
  -- A prose or list description of how to perform the protocol

FOR_AUTHORS.txt
  -- A description for the demo creators of what their demo
     should achieve.
  -- Most of what starts in this file should end up in the
     README file as well.
