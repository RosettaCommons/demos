StepWise Monte Carlo (examples for RNA)

# Brief Description:

Solve structure of an RNA loop or motif in the context of a starting structure.

# Abstract

Ab initio and comparative modeling of biopolymers (RNA, protein, protein/RNA) often involves solving well-defined small puzzles (4 to 20 residues), like RNA aptamers, RNA tertiary contacts, and RNA/protein interactions. If these problems have torsional combinations that have not been seen previously or are not captured by coarse-grained potentials, most Rosetta approaches will fail to recover their structures.  This app implements a stepwise ansatz, originally developed as a 'stepwise assembly' enumeration that was not reliant on fragments or coarse-grained modeling stages, but was computationally expensive. The new mode is a stepwise monte carlo, a stochastic version of stepwise assembly.
