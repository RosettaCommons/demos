# [31]	Cut out a segment of a model:pdbslice.py 3p49_native_RNA.pdb -subset 2-72 81-159 slice_kinkturn_# Here, the 3P49 crystal structure includes an additional G at position 0, which must be excised to allow the leader sequence to be added to the 5´ end, and the internal linker that forms the kink-turn motif with the leader sequence is also excised to allow remodeling.# [32]	Renumber a PDB:renumber_pdb_in_place.py slice_kinkturn_3P49_native_RNA.pdb 10-80 89-167# Here, the PDB is renumbered to allow the leader sequence to be added at the 5´ end.
