## [24]	Example command line from min_cmdline to run as test:# rna_minimize -native glycine_riboswitch_3p49_native_RNA.pdb -cst_fa_file glycine_riboswitch_constraints -params_file glycine_riboswitch.params -ignore_zero_occupancy false -skip_coord_constraints -in:file:silent min_out/0/0.silent -out:file:silent min_out/0/glycine_riboswitch_min.out# [25]	Submit jobs to the cluster:rosetta_submit.py min_cmdline min_out 1 16# The first number states how many processors to use for each line in min_cmdline. Here, enter 1 for the first input so that the total number of processors used will be equal to the number of processors entered with the ‘-proc’ flag in command line [12], above. The second number states the maximum time each job will be allowed to run (walltime).# [26]	Concatenate all models from the min_out folder:easy_cat.py min_out
