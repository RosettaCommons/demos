This demo will demonstrate how to dock a small
molecule at a protein/protein interface. The
idea is to predict the conformation of
rapamycin bound at the interface between 
FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and
FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP).

The crystal structure of the complex (1fap)
has been provided.

You will have to create the appropiate 
residue params file for the rapamycin small
molecule in order to include it in the
simulation.  Though rapamycin's loop structure
is not rigid, only concern yourself with
the conformation it adopts in the crystal
structure.

Your protocol should allow the proteins to
move with respect to each other, and should 
allow rapamycin to move with respect to each
protein.

If you can, please provide an intuition on how
much simulation would be required to generate
reliable results.
