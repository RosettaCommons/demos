Setting up an integration test style test system
Lucas Nivon

This simply steals the integration.py system, placing all tests in tests/, each one needs to have a starting_inputs directory and a command file

Make a tests/ directory with one test in it (copy over the prepare_pdb_for_relax demo)
Copy over integration.py

## run like this
cd rosetta/rosetta_demos/public
python ./demo_test.py -d ../../rosetta_database -j 12

outputs: 
starting_inputs/1A99_1A99_00.pdb
1A99_1A99.pdb_00_0001.pdb
