Goal: Using Rosetta to rebuild a crude/preliminary molecular replacement hit into the electron density


Step 1.  Prepares a template.
Step 2.  Show the phaser command line.
Step 3 and 5.  Rebuilding and refinement in density.

If Step 2 yields no plausible MR hits, run Step 5 without -edensity:* flags and rerun Step 2 on all the output models.  Sometimes this will give the correct MR solution.
