In this tutorial, you will show users how to calculate various metrics of structure quality for protein structures.  Show users how to:

*Calculate Rosetta score and interpret the relevant terms
**Are there clashes?
**bad bond lengths or angles?
**Unreasonable torsions or rotamers?
**number of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds
**packing score (packstat)
**score normalized by protein size
**Solubility score (hpatch)
**Are any residues high-score outliers?

As you write, you will surely think of other metrics relevant to this problem - please include them!  Also, for each metric, discuss how to interpret it and describe rules of thumb for determining if a structure scores well or poorly overall and with respect to one metric.

The suggested application for this tutorial is the base score application, possibly with a RosettaScript (which you can write) to supply fancier metrics like hbond data.  Hpatch comes via a flag to fixbb.

You have been provided with one PDB to use for demonstration: 1UBQ, ubiquitin.

If there is a Rosetta publication discussing these terms, please cite it.
