# RosettaScripts example scripts
---------------------------------

KEYWORDS: SCRIPTING_INTERFACES GENERAL

This is not a demo _per se_, but rather a collection of various scripts for use with RosettaScripts.

Ideally these should get more extensive (working) examples written for them in their own individual directories.
(Note to Rosetta Developers: Do not add additional scripts to this directory. Make a new complete demo instead.)
