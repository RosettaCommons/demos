This script can be used to scan across a set of residues with a filter. It will create a detailed list of the consequences of mutations in each allowed position as well as output a resfile containing all allowable residues according to the filter. After each mutation a user-defined relax mover is called.

Potential uses: scan all positions in a set of scaffolds to identify mutations that won't destabilize the protein too much; residue scans (ala, trp, etc.) on a large set of proteins.

Before running, the input structures must be refined. I suggest using the ppk.xml script with jump=1 before doing filterscan with unbound=1, o/w the baseline won't make sense
