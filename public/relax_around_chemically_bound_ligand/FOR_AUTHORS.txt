The purpose of this demo is to relax a protein
with a chemically attached small molecule.

The "LOV2" domain binds a flavin and, when exposed
to blue light, forms a thiol bond at CYS 450 to
this flavin.  One question that would be nice
to answer is what effect this chemical bond
has on the stability of the LOV2 domain, since
it is known that after this bond forms, the
C-terminal "J-alpha" helix unfolds.

To address this with Rosetta, we would like to 
run relax on the starting structure while
preserving this chemical bond.  The crystal
structure 2v0w was made by crystalizing the LOV2
domain in the dark, and then exposing the crystals
to light.  The thiol bond between CYS 450 and the
flavin is visible in the structure.

This requires:

1) creating the appropriate residue parameter files
for Rosetta for representing the flavin;

2) appropriately labeling the starting PDB file
so that rosetta will recognize and respect the chemical
bond between CYS 450 and the flavin.

3) providing command lines so that Rosetta will relax
the rest of the protein around the flavin.  This may
require using constraints between the flavin and CYS
450 in order to ensure that the chemical bond is not
distorted by the relaxation.

NOTE: if you renumber the residues on the input PDB,
make sure to provide all scripts necessary for this
renumbering.
