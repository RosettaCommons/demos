#Loop Remodel

KEYWORDS: SCRIPTING_INTERFACES LOOPS

In this demo, we use a simple script to show how the LoopRemodel works in context of Rosetta scripts. For more information please refer to [Tutorials](path-to-tutorials).

The 3a67.ppk.pdb is a prepacked pdb that is ready in the inputs file. Run the loop_remodel.xml using this command: (`$ROSETTA3`= path-to-Rosetta/main/source)
```
$> $ROSETTA3/bin/rosetta_scripts.default.linuxgccrelease @flags
```
An example output is placed in the outputs directory.
