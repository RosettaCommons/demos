This folder contains the tutorial PDF instructions for using both the 
burial_measure_centroid application and the HRFMSLabeling score term.

The application is used to calculate the centroid based neighbor counts
for an input PDB. The HRFMSLabeling score term is to be used for rescoring
models previously generated with Rosetta using experimental labeling
data as an input.

Also included with in this directory is the set of input files required
to run all of the instructions within the tutorial PDF.
