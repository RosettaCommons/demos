	<FILTERS>
		Here we specify a delta G filter to calculate the delta G of binding before and after mutations are made.
		We specify a jump number of 3 because want to calculate the delta G of binding the ligand, which is chain D
		in the given PDB file.
		<Ddg name="ddg_filter" threshold="1000" repeats="3" jump="3"/>
	</FILTERS>
	<TASKOPERATIONS>
			Here we add a task operation used to specify that we want only to repack residues without design
			<RestrictToRepacking name="repack_only" />
			Here we specify the location of the resfile to use for design.
			<ReadResfile name="resfile" filename="UbcH7-A98W.resfile"/>
	</TASKOPERATIONS>
	<MOVERS>
		Here is a mover to relax the crystal structure
		We've turned this off, as pre-relaxing the structure once for multiple mutations will be faster
		FastRelax name=relax/>
		Here we pack the rotamers without any design
		<PackRotamersMover name="pack" task_operations="repack_only"/>
		Here we pack the rotamers with design. We specify to read the resfile containing the mutation we want to design
		<PackRotamersMover name="mut_and_pack" task_operations="resfile"/>
		Here we specify the Movers which will apply the Ddg filter, and then place the appropriate value
		in the scoring terms section of the scorefile or the output structures
		<FilterReportAsPoseExtraScoresMover name="dg_wt"  report_as="ddg_wt"  filter_name="ddg_filter" />
		<FilterReportAsPoseExtraScoresMover name="dg_mut" report_as="ddg_mut" filter_name="ddg_filter" />
	</MOVERS>
	<PROTOCOLS>
		Here we include the movers and filters in the order we want them to run
		Add mover_name=relax/>
		<Add mover_name="pack"/>
		<Add mover_name="dg_wt"/>
		<Add mover_name="mut_and_pack"/>
		<Add mover_name="dg_mut"/>
