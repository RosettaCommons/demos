	<FILTERS>
		Here we add two delta G filters to calculate the delta G of binding before and after mutations are made.
		We specify a jump number of 3 because want to calculate the delta G of binding the ligand, which is chain D
		in the given PDB file.
    <Ddg name=dg_wt threshold=1000 scorefxn=score12 repeats=3 jump=3/>
    <Ddg name=dg_mut threshold=1000 scorefxn=score12 repeats=3 jump=3/>
  </FILTERS>
	<TASKOPERATIONS>
			Here we add a task operation used to specify that we want only to repack residues without design
			<RestrictToRepacking name=repack_only />
			Here we specify the location of the resfile to use for design.
			<ReadResfile name=resfile filename=UbcH7-A98W.resfile/>
	</TASKOPERATIONS>
	<MOVERS>
		Here is a mover to relax the crystal structure
		FastRelax name=relax/>
		Here we pack the rotamers without any design
		<PackRotamersMover name=pack scorefxn=score12 task_operations=repack_only/>
		Here we pack the rotamers with design. We specify to read the resfile containing the mutation we want to design
		<PackRotamersMover name=mut_and_pack scorefxn=score12 task_operations=resfile/>
	</MOVERS>
	<PROTOCOLS>
		Here we include the movers and filters in the order we want them to run
		Add mover_name=relax/>
		<Add mover_name=pack/>
		<Add filter_name=dg_wt/>
		<Add mover_name=mut_and_pack/>
		<Add filter_name=dg_mut/>
