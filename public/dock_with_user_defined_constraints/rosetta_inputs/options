#### BEGIN OPTIONS

# Input Options:

-database /Users/menis/rosetta/minirosetta_database    # Location of the Mini Rosetta database 
-in:file:s rosetta_inputs/2OM2_AB.pdb                  # Location of the starting structre, includes both partners (separated by TER)
-nstruct 1                                             # Number of structures to produce. For demo purposes, producing 1 decoy. In reality,
                                                       # one should produce 1,000 decoys for local refine, and at least 10,000-100,000 structures
                                                       # for global dock or good quality production runs!

# Docking Options:
-dock_pert 3 8 					       # Randomly perturbs the input structure using a gaussian for translation and rotation with 
						       # standard deviation [T] and [R].  Recommended "-dock_pert 3 8"


# Constraint Options:
-constraints:cst_file rosetta_inputs/constraint.cst    # File containing the constraints. Only AtomPair, Ambigious and SiteConstraint will be honored
                                                       # A write up on constraint usage is available: 
                                                       # http://www.rosettacommons.org/manuals/archive/rosetta3.1_user_guide/file_constraints.html

# Output Options:
-out:file:fullatom                                     # Boolean flag to indicate full atom 
-out:file:o demo_output                                # Name of the resulting docked complex
-out:suffix _options
