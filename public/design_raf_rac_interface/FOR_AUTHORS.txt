Note: This demo requires dragging structures in pymol, which may
require a two-button mouse 

This workflow describes designing an interface between Rac and Raf
using RosettaScripts. The protocol is going to redesign an interface
with the goal of binding optimization. Your protocol should design
only the Raf sequence, leaving the Rac sequence as wildtype. Both
sides of the interface should be packed and minimized. Be sure to
describe appropriate numbers of trajectories, rosetta script loop
iterations, and filter thresholds.

Proper post-processing/verification should be described, eg sequence
diversity, energy convergence, RMSD vs. Score plot generation. Refer
users to the InterfaceAnalyzer demo for more extensive decoy
evaluation.

The pre-docked structure should contain chain A of 2ov2.pdb (Rac) and
chain B of 1c1y (Raf). All other chains, ligands, etc. should be
removed.

For this demo, create the pre-docked structure by hand, be sure to
describe alternative methods for generation of pre-docked
conformations (eg, constraints, alignment to native partners, etc).

The protocol should take the 
following form:
	
	LOOP [n-iterations]
		Docking 
		Packing/Sequence optimization
		Minimization

See design_script.xml in the rosetta_inputs folder for a starting template.
