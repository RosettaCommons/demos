# FARFAR2

KEYWORDS: NUCLEIC_ACIDS RNA DENOVO STRUCTURE_PREDICTION FARFAR2

## Purpose

This code is intended to give three-dimensional de novo models of whole RNAs folds, whether single or multi stranded, with the option to include template starting structures.

This test case involves a riboswitch that binds S-adenosyl methionine.

See the [documentation for RNA 3D structure modeling](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/FARFAR2) for more information.
