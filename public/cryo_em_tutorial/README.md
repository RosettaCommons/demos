Modeling using low to medium resolution cryoEM data.
====================================================

KEYWORDS: EXPERIMENTAL_DATA STRUCTURE_PREDICTION

This folder contains material from a tutorial given at Baylor in January 2010,
on the use of Rosetta for structure modeling using low to medium resolution
cryoEM data.  This folder also contains a PDF distributed during the tutorial.

All the examples from the tutorial work with the current release, however, the
executible names and a few of the options have changed since the tutorial was
given.  Always refer to the scripts themselves rather than the command lines
given in the PDF file.
