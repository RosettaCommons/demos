Insulin is a symmetric hexamer formed of three dimers.  Each dimer forms along the beta strand.

The goal of this demo is to run symmetric docking to
a) dock the dimers (held fixed) into a trimer (of dimers), and
b) dock the monomers into a trimer of dimers.

In the first case, you may start from the PDB structure, 1ZEH, which
contains two monomers.

In the second case, you should start from the chain A structure.

Make sure your demo describes thoroughly the input file preparation,
as this is one of the more difficult parts of symmetical modeling
in Rosetta.

NOTE: There are Zn atoms coordinated at the trimer interface in
the crystal structure.  I do not believe Rosetta can handle 
a single zinc being symmetrically coordinated, so, you will
probably want to strip out this Zn.
