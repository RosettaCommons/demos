This demo focuses on the preparation of input parameter files
for a small molecule that specifically instruct Rosetta to 
build rotamers for its hydroxyl hydrogens.  The input file,
cel5_glucan.pdb, contains a small molecule "CTR."

This demo should walk the user through the parameter file
creation process and provide one command line that will repack
the ligand only, and one command line that will repack both
the ligand and the nearby residues.  Since the actual running
time for this demo will be so short, this demo should
also include the outputs generated by each of these two
command lines.
