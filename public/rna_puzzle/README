# Brief Description:

Steps to build a model of a complex RNA fold

# Abstract

This code allows build-up of three-dimensional de novo models of RNAs of sizes up to ~300 nts, given secondary structure and experimental constraints. It can be carried out reasonably automatically, but human curation of submodels along the build-up path may improve accuracy. A fully automated pipeline is also in preparation.

### running #########
# Example Rosetta Command Line:


1. Make helices
rna_helix.py  -o H2.pdb -seq cc gg -resnum 14-15 39-40

2. Use threading to build sub-pieces
This is for a UUCG motif:

Download 1f7y.pdb from 
http://pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1f7y

Slice out the motif of interest
pdbslice.py  1f7y.pdb  -subset B:31-38 uucg_

Thread it into our actual sequence.
