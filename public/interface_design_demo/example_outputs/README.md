These are the scripts/design/*/ directories cp'd after a successsful design
run. The <name-of-protocol>.sh scripts were lightly modified before the runs
to meet the whims of the one particular LSF system and so they may not run for
you. Since the directories have been moved, the selected_chains.list
sym link files are broken since they use relative paths. They are included
as part of a full demonstration of the final state of the directories.
