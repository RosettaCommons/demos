# The benchmarking study in the manuscript used 2000 models for each protein-ligand complex.
# -nstruct is set to 200 because in the example each ligand is docked into an ensemble of 10 models, so 2000 total models will be generated
# in practice, 150-200 total models should be generated for each ligand, rather than 2000.
