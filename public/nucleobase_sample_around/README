# Protocol Name:
nucleobase_sample_around

# Brief Description:

Make tables of interaction energies between an adenosine nucleobase and, say, 
 a simple carbon atom as a probe.

# Abstract

We wanted to compare potentials of mean force of various atoms like a single methyl probe, water, adenosine, etc. around a fixed adenosine to explicit molecular dynamics solutions.

Developed in summer 2012, Das Lab hackathon -- Kyle Beauchamp, Fang-Chieh Chou, Rhiju Das, Parin Sripakdeevong.

# Example Rosetta Command Lines:

To sample a 'carbon' probe atom:
 nucleobase_sample_around   [-s a_RNA.pdb]

To sample a water (sampling all possible orientations and outputting Boltzmann summed free energies)
 nucleobase_sample_around   [-s a_RNA.pdb]  -sample_water  [ -extra_res ~/rosetta_database/chemical/residue_type_sets/fa_standard/residue_types/water/TP3.params ]

To sample a nucleobase
 nucleobase_sample_around   [-s a_RNA.pdb]  -sample_another_nucleobase   -copy_nucleobase_nucleobase_file double_A_ready_set.pdb

To sample an nucleobase, reading in a starting nucleobase-nucleobase pairing conformation.
 nucleobase_sample_around   [-s a_RNA.pdb]  -sample_another_nucleobase   -copy_nucleobase_nucleobase_file double_A_ready_set.pdb

Recently added option

 -nucleobase g [or a,c,u]

which will use another nucleobase to map around.
