As one of the test to evaluate the design we dock the TS structure
into the protein. 

The docking is described in detail in Davis & Baker JMB 2009.

Here a new LG.params is needed as the zinc ion is
kept in the protein and not free to move. 

A constraint file is used for the zinc-ligand distance.

Number of alternative conformations is controlled by -nstruct.
