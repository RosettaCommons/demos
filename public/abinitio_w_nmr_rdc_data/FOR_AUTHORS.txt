This tutorial should explain how to create models using RDC data and
chemical shifts as a constraint.  Oliver recommends using this to build
fragments - www.csrosetta.org/downloads/FRAG_PICKER.tgz

In the starting file directory there is a fasta file, chemical shift data, and
rdcs.  Part of the tutorial should be how to get this information in the 
appropriate format for Rosetta.

Explain how to evaluate the output models based on Rosetta score and agreement
with the NMR data.
