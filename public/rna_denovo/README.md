# RNA De Novo
KEYWORDS: NUCLEIC_ACIDS RNA DENOVO
## Purpose

This code is intended to give three-dimensional de novo models of single-stranded RNAs or multi-stranded RNA motifs, with the prospect of reaching high (near-atomic-resolution) accuracy.

See the [documentation for RNA 3D structure modeling](https://www.rosettacommons.org/manuals/archive/rosetta3.4_user_guide/d2/d82/rna_denovo.html) for more information.
