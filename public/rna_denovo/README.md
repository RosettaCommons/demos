# RNA De Novo

KEYWORDS: NUCLEIC_ACIDS RNA DENOVO STRUCTURE_PREDICTION

## Purpose

This code is intended to give three-dimensional de novo models of single-stranded RNAs or multi-stranded RNA motifs, with the prospect of reaching high (near-atomic-resolution) accuracy.

This test case involves the most conserved region of the signal recognition particle, a 4x4 RNA internal loop.

See the [documentation for RNA 3D structure modeling](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/rna/rna-denovo) for more information.
