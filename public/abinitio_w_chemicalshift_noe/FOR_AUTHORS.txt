This tutorial should describe how to create protein models using NOE data as constraints.
Instructions for how to interpret the results should be provided, for instance how well do the models match the NOE data.  Is there a way to get a list of violations?  
An instruction is now added in the README.
What models should be used as the 'final' answer?
Final models are selected based on energy and clustering.
