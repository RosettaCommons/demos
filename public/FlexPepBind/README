To run the protocol on each system go the directory and then
1.run scripts/fpbind_run.sh  ( This will minize the peptide after threading it on the template)
2.run scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh ( Extract the scores of the minimized structure & save it in score_analysis/ directory)

Ex. 

cd HDAC8/
scripts/fpbind_run.sh 
run scripts/fpbind_analysis.sh

output is the score with different scoring term 
For example in score_analysis/pep_sc_noref
$cat score_analysis/pep_sc_noref
-5.100
-6.715
-5.489
-5.124
-6.765
-2.972
-1.996
-2.625
-2.065
0.831


pep_sc_noref scores for 10 peptide (top5 binders & bottom 5 are non binders)
