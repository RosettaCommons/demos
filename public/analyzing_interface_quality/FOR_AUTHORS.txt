In this tutorial, you will show users how to calculate various metrics of structure quality for protein-protein interfaces.  Show users how to:

*Calculate Rosetta score and interpret the relevant terms
**Are there clashes?
*Calculate protein-protein interface related metrics
**binding energy
**number of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds
**packing score (packstat)
**Buried surface area
**surface area normalized by interface binding energy

As you write, you will surely think of other metrics relevant to this problem - please include them!  Also, for each metric, discuss how to interpret it and describe rules of thumb for determining if a structure scores well or poorly overall and with respect to one metric.

The suggested application for this tutorial is InterfaceAnalyzer.  It is extensively documented already; feel free to steal!

You have been provided with two PDBs to use for demonstration: 1U6E, a simple homodimer, and 3R2X, Sarel's hemaglutinin/designed protein structure.  In the latter case, be sure to calculate the interface between the designed protein and the HA - the interface between HA chains is unimportant.

If there is a Rosetta publication discussing these terms, please cite it.
