This demo should thread the fasta sequence (fasta.txt) onto the starting PDB (2v0u.pdb).  The fasta file contains the sequence of a protein whose core is homologous to the PDB structure, however has an extension on the N-terminus.  The demo should use abinitio to model the new core sequence as well as the N-terminal extension.  A description of how to generate fragments for modelling the N-terminal sequence and the alignment files should be included.  The author can choose how much flexibility should be allowed in the core for the demo, but it would be helpful to discuss how to use either more strict or more relaxed constraints.  Finally, give a brief idea of how the user should begin to process the output.
