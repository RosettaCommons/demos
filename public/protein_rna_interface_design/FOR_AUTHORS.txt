The purpose of this demo is to show how rosetta could be used to design a protein at an RNA/protein interface. The task is to use rosetta to make predictions about residues that would stabilize the protein/RNA interaction

To accomplish this you will need to do some modifications to rosetta, see the guidelines in:
mini/doc/RNA_protein_compatability.dox  
Make sure this file is complete with everything that needs to be done.

The files provided are is the crystal structure of the spliceosomal U2B"-U2A' protein complex bound to a fragment of U2 small nuclear RNA (1a9n.pbd)  The chains for one biological unit have been selected and make into the file 1a9n_ABQ.pdb 

You should use fixbb or some other protocol to redesign a few residues at the RNA/protein interface.  You can use a resfile or automatic detection if you are feeling plucky.  

This info below is the basic outline of what goes where:
starting_files/
  -- directory in which the raw input files are given - these
     are provided for you and serve as the base for your
     tutorial
rosetta_inputs/
  -- directory in which the modified starting files should
     be placed which will be used as inputs to Rosetta.
     You may need to make modifications like stripping
     extra chains from the input PDB; store the modified
     PDB here and leave the unaltered one in starting_files 
scripts/
  -- python scripts, shell scripts, used in the workflow
  -- awk, grep, sed, etc. command lines

README.dox
  -- A prose or list description of how to perform the protocol

FOR_AUTHORS.txt
  -- A description for the demo creators of what their demo
     should achieve.
  -- Most of what starts in this file should end up in the
     README file as well.
