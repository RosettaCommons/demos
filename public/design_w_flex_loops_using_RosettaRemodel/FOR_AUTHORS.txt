The task: Redesign the monobody HA4 to have tighter affinity for the Abl SH2
domain allowing backbone flexibility in the loops of the monobody.

       Inputs:  3k2m.pdb (use chains c and b)

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how design with backbone flexibility
can be implemented.  In particular, your task is to redesign portions of the 
monobody, allowing its loops to change their conformation, so that the total
energy of the monobody/AblSH2 complex is improved.  The sequence of AblSH2
should not change, though, you should allow its rotamers to repack. This task
will likely include iterative loop modeling followed by fixed-backbone
sequence design.

Make sure you document the way in which you told Rosetta which residues
should be given backbone flexibility, which residues should be given sequence
flexibility, and which residues should be given conformational flexibility.
