This tutorial should explain how to calculate delta-delta-g of binding
for a variety of points mutations made at the interface of e6ap and ubch7. The
point mutants to evaluate can be found in starting_files/mutations_to_evaluate.txt 

There are several ways to accomplish this task, some options are below:

option 1:
-run interface analyzer on the native interface, note the delta-G of binding
-run fixBB using a resfile to specify the desired point mutant
-rerun interface analyzer on the mutated interface, note the delta-G of binding
-use the two delta-Gs to calculate delta-delta-G of the mutation

option 2:
-run interface analyzer on the native interface, note the delta-G of binding
-create a rosettaScript to runs the PackRotamersMover with a resfile, followed
by running the interfaceAnalyzer.
-use the two delta-Gs to calculate the delta-delta-G of the mutation
